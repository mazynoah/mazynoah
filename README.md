Hi, I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for learning new technologies and expanding my skillset. Recently, I've been learning Rust and have been greatly enjoying the experience. I am also familiar with JavaScript and TypeScript, and have some medium understanding of CSS and C#.

My goal is to improve my skills in Rust. I am continuously learning, and looking for new technologies to toy with.

You can find my projects on my GitHub profile, feel free to check them out!
